          <h2 class="title">Guitarist: John Frusciante</h2>
          <p class="elite">
            John Frusciante is the creative force behind the Red Hot Chili
            Peppers' most iconic sound, blending funk, rock, and psychedelic
            influences. His guitar work, known for its melodic simplicity and
            raw emotional expression, has been central to albums like
            Californication, By the Way, and Stadium Arcadium. Frusciante's
            ability to create catchy riffs while maintaining a sense of intimacy
            makes him stand out among modern rock guitarists. His love for
            experimental music and boundary-pushing techniques is matched by his
            soulful playing, which gives the Peppers their signature sound—a
            perfect mix of groove, emotion, and sonic depth.

          <p class="elite">
            Tetsuya Ogawa, also known simply as "Tetsuya," is the legendary
            bassist and leader of L'Arc-en-Ciel, one of Japan's most successful

            technical proficiency, adding complexity and groove to the band's

            intricate details, complementing the band’s mix of rock, pop, and
            symphonic elements. His use of the pick gives his playing a bright,
            distinct tone that defines hits like "Ready Steady Go" and "Honey."
            As a songwriter and band leader, Tetsuya's vision has helped

          <h2 class="title">Drummer: Tre Cool</h2>
          <p class="elite">
            Tré Cool, the powerhouse drummer of Green Day, is known for his
            energetic and wild style. He brings a punk rock edge to the band's
            sound, driving songs with fast tempos, explosive fills, and a sense
            of humor. His contributions to Green Day’s seminal albums like
            Dookie, American Idiot, and Nimrod showcase his versatility and
            tight, hard-hitting drumming. Tré's playful personality is evident
            in both his live performances and his creative drumming, which
            ranges from controlled chaos to anthemic beats. He plays with
            precision but always adds his own unpredictable flair, making him a
            standout drummer in punk rock.

          <h2 class="title">Vocalist: Lane Staley</h2>
          <p class="elite">
            Layne Staley, the haunting voice of Alice in Chains, was one of the
            defining vocalists of the grunge era. His deep, resonant voice
            carried immense emotional weight, conveying pain, introspection, and
            intensity. Staley’s harmonies with guitarist Jerry Cantrell created
            a signature sound, blending heavy metal riffs with dark, brooding
            melodies. His performances on songs like "Man in the Box,"
            "Rooster," and "Down in a Hole" are unforgettable, filled with raw
            power and vulnerability. Despite his struggles with addiction,
            Staley’s impact on rock music endures, influencing countless artists
            with his distinctive voice and emotional honesty.

      <h2 class="text-center title">why them?</h2>
      <p class="elite margin-20">
        I’ve always dreamed of forming a band that captures the spirit of all my
        favorite musicians, each of whom represents a unique element of rock
        music that deeply resonates with me. John Frusciante’s guitar playing is
        rooted in old psychedelic rock, drawing on the ethereal, expressive
        style of Jimi Hendrix. His ability to layer textures and craft emotive,
        expansive solos makes him the ideal guitarist for the band. His
        character brings a sense of soul and depth that can take the music to a
        spiritual level. On drums, I’d choose Tre Cool from Green Day. His
        powerful drumming style and unmistakable punk rock attitude would bring
        raw energy and aggression to the band. His fast, hard-hitting beats
        would perfectly contrast with Frusciante’s fluid guitar work, creating a
        dynamic sound that’s both grounded and explosive. For the bass, Tetsuya
        Ogawa from L’Arc-en-Ciel is a must. His melodic bass playing is vibrant
        and fun, adding a uniquely Japanese rock vibe to the mix. His ability to
        groove while keeping the foundation of the music intact makes him the
        perfect complement to Tre Cool's drumming. Tetsu’s lines would inject a
        playful energy into the band's sound. Finally, Lane Staley’s powerful
        vocals, which defined the grunge rock era of the 90s, would tie
        everything together. His voice is haunting and raw, capable of
        delivering emotional depth and intensity that no other singer can
        replicate. Together, they’d create a genre-bending band that combines
        psychedelic, punk, melodic rock, and grunge into something entirely
        new—my ultimate dream lineup.
